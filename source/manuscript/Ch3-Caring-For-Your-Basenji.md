# Caring For Your Basenji


## IMMUNIZATIONS/WORMING

    Preventive Immunizations are a vital part of the health care of your puppy.  The following serious, often fatal diseases are preventable through early immunization, followed by regular boosters.

Distemper  (D):  A highly-infectious viral disease of young dogs - often fatal, characterized by rhinitis and fever.

Hepatitis  (H):  A viral infection characterized by inflammation of the liver.

Leptospirosis  (L):  A series of bacterial infections cause by several members of the genus Leptospira, involving liver and kidneys.

Parainfluenza  (P):  and/or Adenovirus type 2 (A2):  A complex of viral respiratory infections, characterized by bronchitis, including "Kennel Cough".

Parvovirus  (PV):  A viral infection characterized by severe enteritis with vomiting and bloody diarrhea - often rapidly fatal in young pups.

Coronavirus  (CV):  Similar to Parvovirus, but somewhat less severe.

Rabies:  An always-fatal viral disease of the central nervous system.

When your puppy is born, his own immune sys-tem is not fully mature and is not capable of making antibodies against infectious diseases.  The pup is afforded some protection at birth and during the early weeks of his life by maternal antibodies acquired from his mother.  If she is immune to the various diseases, the pup will acquire immunity from her blood via the placenta, and her milk as he nurses after birth.  During the first few weeks of life, as the pup's own immune system develops, the level of maternal antibody falls.  At some point in the pup's early life, he will be unprotected and susceptible to the infectious diseases.  It is at this point that preventive immunizations must be begun, to stimulate the pup's own immune system to produce antibodies.

 

There is a difference of opinion among authorities, veterinarians, and breeders, as to the best time to begin immunization, i.e., vaccination.  If begun too early, immunizations may be ineffective for either of two reasons:  1) the pup's own immune system may not yet be mature and capable of making antibodies; 2) maternal antibodies may interfere with the action of the vaccine on the pup's immune system.  If begun too late, the pup is left unprotected.  Therefore a series of vaccinations is recommended.

Also, during the first few months of life, the pup should be protected from unnecessary exposure to other dogs.

The following schedule of immunizations is a guideline based on a consensus of opinions of vets and breeders.  Using this schedule as a guideline, you should consult your breeder and your vet as to what vaccinations your pup has already had, what vaccinations should be given, and on what schedule.

Immunization Schedule

Parvovirus vaccine may be given in combinations with DHLP OR DA 2PL or given separately on a staggered schedule spaced between the DHLP'S. Parvo vaccine is available either as a killed virus or modified live virus vaccine.  There is a difference of opinion among authorities as to the vaccine of choice.  The most recent opinion is that the modified live vaccine is both safe and more effective in stimulating antibodies, and is subject to less interference from maternal antibodies, hence affording earlier protection.  Again, consult your breeder and vet.

Coronavirus vaccine is the newest of the vaccines, first available in 1985.  It is a killed virus vaccine, available separately or in combinations with the other vaccines.

If your pup will be exposed to other dogs at an early age, as at dog shows or in traveling, PV and CV vaccines may be given as early as six weeks of age.  If so, at least one dose should be given after ten weeks of age and a booster dose given at six months of age.

Rabies is not endemic in the Seattle area. How-ever, immunization between six months and one year of age is recommended.  If your pup is to travel to a rabies area, rabies immunization may be given at four months of age; a booster must then be given at one year and thereafter every three years. Killed rabies vaccine is recommended as safe and effective.

If you will be traveling with your dog to Canada, proof of Rabies vaccination is required to cross the border.  For pups too young for a rabies shot, contact the customs office for specific instructions.

Heartworm is a mosquito borne parasite infesta-tion characterized by larvae in the bloodstream which settle out and mature into adult worms in the heart.  Treatment of the disease is difficult; either the treat-ment or the untreated disease may be fatal.  There is no immunization for this disease; however, a preven-tive medication is available.  Heartworm is not presently a problem in the Northwestern United States; but if your pup is to travel, or you live in an affected area ask your vet if preventive medication is recommended for your area or where he will be going. Medication must be administered daily for one month before, during and for three months after possible exposure.  Be sure to check with your vet early.

The dog must be tested for heartworm before any preventive medication can be given.  Failure to do so may be fatal if there is an existing infestation.  New medications such as “Heart- Guard” have been developed which only need to be administered monthly.  Check with your veterinarian for the availability of these.

This vital part of your pup's health is entrusted to you, with the advice and assistance of your breeder and your veterinarian. Good luck to you, good health and happiness to your new pup!

A word about worms

Worms are a common nuisance and health prob-lem for basenjis as well as all dogs.  Several species of round worms and tape worms are common.  Some breeders prefer routine worming of pups, but others and most vets prefer to have stool specimens checked for the presence of worm ova (eggs) and treat only the affected animals.  Check with your breeder to see if your puppy has been wormed, what medication was used, and when.  Symptoms of worms, such as weight loss, pot bellies, and shabby coat, often go unnoticed until infestation is heavy.  A good suggestion is to take a stool specimen for examination when you take your pup for its first health check and again each year when he goes for his annual vaccinations or sooner if you suspect worms.

You should also watch your dog's stools for tapeworms.  Tapeworm ova are often missed on a stool microscopic exam, since they are found inside the worm segments that break off and are passed in the stool.  Tapeworm segments are easily seen with the naked eye on the surface of fresh stool or clinging to the anal area.  They are whitish, about the size of a grain of rice, and sometimes may be seen moving!  If you see tapeworm segments, take your dog to the vet and request the Droncit medication, available in pill or injectable form.  This medication is considered safe and more effective than over the counter medications.

GROOMING

The short sleek coat of the Basenji requires very little grooming to look its best.  Your dog will keep himself clean, sometimes even using his tongue much like a cat does.

For that rare bath use a shampoo specifically made for dogs. Keep the water out of his eyes and ears by using a washcloth on his face.

In the spring, your dog may 'blow his coat' or lose his fuzzy undercoat if he has grown one in the winter.  You will find his hair will come out easily with a pinch of your fingers.  This normal shedding process can be hastened by the use of either a stripping comb, a shedding blade, a rubber curry, or a 'hound glove'.  These items can be found at any pet store.  Do not use metal combs or brushes with metal pins, as these are too harsh for the short coat and fine skin.  Some owners get good results using the edge of a hacksaw blade rubbed along with the grain of the coat to pull out dead hair.  Ask your breeder to show you this method of removing the loose dead hair.  During most of the year you will notice very little shedding from your dog's coat.

If you are going to show your dog, the amount of grooming required is dependent on your dog's coat. Some dogs may need a bit of trimming to give the tail or fringe along the back of his legs a neater appear-ance.  Ask someone to show you the correct way to do this trimming, if you think your dog needs it, so it will appear neat and not just hacked away.  Most breeders do not trim the whiskers or the hair inside the ears, as these serve as sensory and protective functions necessary for the health of your dog.

There are various sprays and coat conditioners available that, depending on your dog's coat, you may or may not want to try. Consult the AKC rules pertaining to their use for the show ring. Most dogs require only a bath the night before a show.

Your dog's toenails will require an occasional clipping to keep his feet in good health.  His dewclaws were removed when he was just a few days old, so he has just 4 toes on each foot.  The necessary frequency of cutting is dependent on several factors: rate of growth, amount of exercise on what types of surfaces, and the age of your dog (puppy nails tend to grow faster).  The front feet may need cutting more often than the rear feet.  It is best to snip off a small amount, more frequently, rather than waiting until the nails are long so that you need to snip off a big chunk.

 

There are several different types of clippers and grinders available.  Their ease of use depends mostly on what you practice and get used to. Clipping nails is not difficult, but does take some practice.  If at all possible, avoid taking him to the vet to have it done.  Ask your breeder or resource person to show you the correct way to do it.

The first few times you trim your dog's nails he will probably hate it, fighting and struggling to get away.  You must be firm in holding the dog, but be careful not to squeeze or pinch his paws.  Have another person hold the dog if necessary while you clip; kneel on the floor with the dog between your knees.  Do not allow the dog to struggle and get away.  Hold him firmly until you are done with one paw (or one nail if he is really struggling), then set the clipper down and continue to hold him until he is quiet, then release him (with lots of praise). Remember, if he struggles and gets away he will struggle harder the next time.  You are the boss and should always win the battle. If he learns that struggling will get him nowhere, he will soon learn to sit quietly while you do the clipping.  If you are consistent, even the worst dog will eventually be quiet while you do his nails.

Be very careful not to cut into the 'quick' (the blood and nerve supply to the nail).  It is best to snip off a tiny amount of nail and make two snips per nail rather than trying to snip off one big chunk.

BASENJI HEALTH

Our friend the Basenji is a sturdy little breed from Africa, and when compared to other purebred breeds has few health problems.  This article is a summary and introduction to some of the more prevalent dis-eases.

Persistent Pupillary Membrane

Persistent Pupillary Membrane is not life threaten-ing, but should be considered when planning any breeding program.

During fetal development, a fibrovasular tissue, the Pupillary Membrane forms a layer across the front of the eye to form a blood supply to nourish the developing lens.  In the normal course of events, this temporary vascular mesoderm regresses and deterio-rates and is generally completely gone by the time the puppy is 14 days old.

When the Pupillary Membrane does not deteriorate completely by age 14 days, it is labeled Persistent Pupillary Membrane (PPM). It may persist for several months before disappearing, or the remaining strands may attach to the cornea or lens creating cataracts.

PPMs come in all shapes, sizes, and severities, may be very extensive and visible to the naked eye, or may be very small and require considerable magnification to be seen.  As a general rule, the condition does not significantly reduce vision but in extreme cases may cause marked reduction in vision or even blindness.  It has been estimated that the majority of basenjis do have PPM to some degree.

 

There are four levels/degrees of PPM.  The least offensive affection is “iris to iris.”  This means that the PPM strand(s) are attached on each end to the iris, thus not affecting the vision of the hound in any way although apparently the membrane did not detach correctly.  Young puppies who are diagnosed as being mildly affected can be tested again at one year of age and perhaps be diagnosed as “clear.” This is because the young puppy’s membranes may not have had a chance to completely detach before the first exam.  PPM that does not clear up by one year of age is not going to.  The second level of PPM is “iris to lens;”  more often than not, this level of PPM is “permanent” and will not improve to the point of testing “clear.”  The third level of PPM is “iris to cornea,” this can sometimes be seen by the naked eye.  It appears to be a light blue iridescent spot on the eyeball.  The worst level of PPM is “iris sheets” that literally shield the eye with a light blue cast that can look “pretty” to the novice puppy buyer.

PPM is believed to be an inherited failure of the pupillary membrane to deteriorate at the proper time.  The exact mode of inheritance of PPMs has not been determined.  Siblings of the same litter may be mildly or severely affected, and mildly affected animals may produce severely afflicted offspring.  It is also not known what effect the pregnant bitch's diet may have on the development of PPM.

Examination for PPMs should be done by a vet-erinarian ophthalmologist through the use of a 'slit lamp' exam when the puppy is 2-4 months of age.

Coloboma is a depression or perforation in the optic disk which is sometimes associated with PPM.  An examination for this condition should be made when checking for PPM.

CERF

When a board certified ophthalmologist performs a “slit lamp” exam on a basenji, the basenji must be at least seven weeks of age.  The doctor views each eye, and judges them independently. One eye may be clear, and the other eye may be affected to some degree.  Some breeders rate their litters partially on the results of this test; others find it beneficial to track which breedings produce any PPM at any stage.  If a puppy or an adult is found to be clear of eye concerns at the time of testing, a board certified ophthalmologist may declare the basenji as phenotypically “clear,” and issue a CERF certificate from the Canine Eye Registration Foundation.  As of 2002, a basenji having minor (iris to iris) PPM can now receive a CERF.   Although this is a distinguished rating, a “CERFed” basenji is not necessarily genetically clear.  A CERF rating is valid for one year from the date of the exam.

Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA)

PRA affects the retina, which is the 'picture screen' at the back of the eye.  PRA causes the blood vessels of the retina to atrophy and die. When the retina dies, the 'picture screen' no longer functions and the dog becomes blind.  This condition is irreversible, and there is no cure.  PRA has been found in several different breeds of dogs, and although some breeds vary in the age of onset, they share the same clinical abnormalities and signs (night blindness, progressive loss of day vision, and total blindness).  The typical age of onset for PRA has not been established for the Basenji.  It has shown up as early as age 3 and as late as age 6.  This late onset complicates efforts to breed away from the disease.  Testing is done by ophthalmic exam by a Board Certified Ophthalmologist.  A dog testing clear of PRA at age 5 or 6 may still develop the disease later on. Ophthalmoscope examinations should be repeated annually.  If an abnormality is detected, further testing can confirm or rule out PRA.  

The suspected mode of inheritance is through a simple recessive gene (see HA section below).  A carrier can be "normal-eyed", but can produce afflicted dogs if bred to another carrier.  PRA research is ongoing and has resulted in positive DNA tests for carrier status in several breeds.  The Basenji community is currently working towards a DNA test to identify carrier status in Basenjis.  As of this printing, however, the only way to control the incidence of PRA in Basenjis is by thorough research of, and high confidence in the pedigrees of the sire and dam so as not to breed possible carriers.

Hemolytic Anemia

Hemolytic Anemia at one time was considered a major threat to the breed but today is rarely seen. This is a real triumph for the breeders who worked so hard to eliminate the disease.

H.A. is a condition in which the red blood cells are destroyed more rapidly than normal.  This genetically transmitted disease is caused by a partial lack of a very important enzyme in the red blood cells called Pyruvate Kinase (PK for short). A similar anemia (due to PK deficiency) has been known to occur in man.

Symptoms for the dogs begin very early and owners notice that the affected animals tire easily and sleep a great deal.  Most succumb when approximately two years of age.

In the early 1970's, much research into this disease proved that PK deficiency in the Basenji was due to a recessive gene. This means that basenjis could be divided into three categories:

1) Those clear of the disease (a dog which has 2 genes for normal PK activity).

2) A carrier (a dog which has one gene for normal PK activity and one gene for PK deficiency). This is a healthy animal which will not have HA, which should have normal behavior and activity, and a normal life span.

3) An affected dog (a dog which carries two genes for PK deficiency).

The extensive research done at that time led to sensitive testing that could distinguish between the clear, carrier, and affected animals.

Through discriminate breeding practices, avoiding mating a carrier to a carrier, and continued testing over several generations, HA has been drastically reduced.  There have been recent reports of HA affected dogs, so testing is still being continued.

Fanconi Syndrome

Fanconi Syndrome is a renal tubular dysfunction that was first reported in the Basenji in 1976, and has since drawn the interest of researchers due to its simi-larity to Human Fanconi Disease.  It has also been found in several of the other breeds.  While Fanconi Syndrome is thought to be at least partially (if not fully) inherited, the mode of inheritance is unknown. Current research is aimed at using DNA to discover the mode of inheritance so the disease can be prevented.

The normal function of the kidney is to "filter" the blood, reclaiming amino acids, salts, and various important chemicals and letting the wastes go into the urine.  With Fanconi Syndrome, the cells of the proximal tubule in the kidney do not function properly so those things that should be reclaimed go into the urine.  The body thus loses vital constituents needed for normal functions.

Symptoms of this disorder are polydipsia (in-creased thirst), polyuria (frequent urination), dehydration, weight loss, changes in haircoat, and weakness.  These signs can mimic diabetes. However, there are no correspondingly high  levels.  Many vets have falsely labeled the disorder diabetes, kidney failure or thyroid deficiency due to lack of knowledge of the syndrome. Since Fanconi Syndrome is rare outside basenjis, you should always mention this to the vet when diagnosing a problem.  The signs may appear as early as the age of three, but basenjis between the ages of five and eight have shown the highest rate of occurrence.  Unfortunately, by this age, the dogs may have passed the condition on to new generations. 

While there is yet no cure for Fanconi Syndrome, research does go on.  Meanwhile, the prognosis for your affected basenji is good thanks to the “Fanconi Management Protocol for Veterinarians” developed by Dr Steve Gonto of Georgia (see appendix).  This involves working with your veterinarian on identifying your dog's metabolic deficiencies and place them on a vitamin, mineral, bicarbonate, replacement regimen, combined with a high protein diet, to make up for the kidney's losses.  A Fanconi dog has what is termed medically as 'high output' failure.  There is NO problem with toxin build up since the kidney is filtering things OUT just fine. Thus, the treatment for Fanconi involves almost the opposite of 'low output failure'.  Fanconi dogs need free access to clean water, high protein diets, and the replacement of whatever electrolytes and bicarbonate they are urinating away, in order to restore a normal blood chemistry and acid base balance.  Periodic follow up blood work to measure electrolytes and venous pH will be essential to the maintenance of your affected pet's health.  With proper medical man-agement, Fanconi Syndrome does NOT have to be a slowly debilitating, lethal condition and affected dogs may expect an active full life expectancy.  The protocol changes infrequently, so please see the appendix to find out if it is current.

IPSID

Case reports of a chronic intractable diarrhea in the Basenji have been discussed in the veterinary literature since the early 1960's.  It was called by various names such as Basenji Diarrhea Syndrome, Chronic Intractable Diarrhea, or Malabsorption Syndrome. In the early 1980's the combination of signs and symptoms was labeled Immunoproliferative Small Intestinal Disease (IPSID).

IPSID is a genetically-mediated severely debilitat-ing diarrhea disease of the Basenji.  Clinical symptoms can be various -- you may see chronic diarrhea, poor appetite, aversion to food, occasional vomiting, weight loss, wasting, dry coat & skin, hair loss, etc.  The disease is characterized by variable age of onset, malabsorption, protein-losing enteropathy, and abnormal immune function.

 

Most dogs afflicted with this disorder will experi-ence progressive emaciation associated with chronic diarrhea, or a cyclically exacerbating course, charac-terized by episodes of anorexia and/or diarrhea.  Many times it is precipitated by a stressful episode, such as boarding, transport, estrus, pregnancy, major surgery, or even exhibition at dog shows.

An electrophoresis study of the serum (the liquid portion of the blood) shows a marked increase in the gamma globulins and a corresponding decrease in the albumin.  These changes noted in the Protein Electro-phoresis Test (P.E.T.) have proven to be a useful tool in confirming the diagnosis of IPSID in dogs with some of the symptoms.

Current research is aimed at the effects of diet on the development and course of the disease; treatments with antibiotic and vitamin therapies; and attempts to discover the mode of inheritance.

Pancreatic Enzyme Deficiency

The symptoms of this disorder may appear similar to IPSID. The dog will be unthrifty and appear undernourished.  The dog will have frequent copious amounts of loose, fatty appearing stools. The disorder is frequently triggered by a stressful event such as a dog fight or surgery.

Diagnoses can be made by having a stool sample checked for the presence or absence of the pancreatic enzymes.  Treatment consists of a combination of an easily digestible diet and supplemental pancreatic enzymes.

Umbilical Hernia

Umbilical Hernia results from failure of the umbilical ring to close after birth allowing protrusion of fatty tissue (belly button).  In severe cases, the intestinal lining protrudes which can cause intestinal blockage. In most cases, the umbilical ring will even-tually close, leaving a small lump of fatty tissue for a belly button.

Young puppies whose umbilical ring has not closed can benefit from repeatedly reducing the hernia by gently pressing in with your thumb.  The pup should always be lifted with a hand under its tummy to support any hernia.

If the hernia itself should appear red or inflamed, seek immediate medical attention.  If the hernia should fail to close by one year of age, it should be surgically repaired, and the dog should not be bred.  Dogs requiring surgical repair are still  eligible to be shown in AKC conformation, and some owners choose to remove the fatty tissue for purely cosmetic reasons.  

Hypothyroid

Thyroid deficiency is characterized by a coarse brittle coat, aggressiveness, lethargy, obesity, mental dullness, and irregular heat cycles.  Trainers have noted a definite improvement in behavior with dogs which have tested low normal range of thyroid when given a low dose thyroid supplement. Diagnosis requires a thyroid blood test.  Basenji bitches who have whelped puppies would benefit from a thyroid blood test before being bred again. A thyroid imbalance often occurs as a result of whelping.

The current threats to the breed are Fanconi Syn-drome, PRA and IPSID, as outlined above.  Since research into these diseases is ongoing and constantly changing, specific information about theories and testing studies has not been included in this manual.  Contact your breeder to find out what studies may have been done on your puppy and his parents.  Your breeder or breed club will be able to provide you with current information on research studies pertaining to these disorders.

 

If your basenji has any serious health problem, make sure you contact the breeder.  Breeders need to be informed of these serious health problems in order to assess breeding programs and to determine where further research is necessary.

CHOOSING A VET

Choosing a vet for your basenji should be taken very seriously, as if it were a family doctor. Misdiag-noses or improper treatment can cause serious problems and expense for you and your basenji.

The breeder of your dog or other basenji breeders may be able to recommend a vet in your area. Ask your prospective vet if he has treated basenjis in the past and if he has any current clients that own a basenji.  Ask for references and check on them.

Basenjis don't take kindly to poking and prodding and have gained a reputation of being biters with some vets, especially those who have treated some of the earlier dogs.  Your vet should treat your basenji with respect for the dog that he is, exercising cautions, for a basenji will bite when threatened or in pain, as will many other dogs. Overly cautious and fearful vets will be mistrusted by your basenji, and should be avoided.

Has this vet studied recent basenji research?  If not, provide him with a photocopy of this health sec-tion.  Its very important your vet be well informed of current health problems. Often, Fanconi Syndrome is misdiagnosed as diabetes, with the dog having a fatal reaction to insulin.  Or, on the other side, the vet assumes the anemic dog must have Hemolytic Anemia on the basis that this once was very common with the breed.

A few basenjis are rather sensitive to foreign sub-stances in their systems, such as flea bites, tranquilizers, vaccines etc.  The vet should always be prepared to administer an antitoxin or antidote should a reaction occur.  He should never use substances that cannot be immediately neutralized. Sedatives and tranquilizers should be given only when absolutely necessary and in small trial dosages. Allergies to flea or other substances resulting in itching/scratching cycles are often treated with steroids, which treats the symptoms and not the underlying problem.  This can create additional problems with side effects.

If in doubt with a vet's diagnosis, don't hesitate to ask for a second opinion, or a referral to another vet.  Take a serious interest in the care given to your basenji to assure your dog's good health and reasonable vet fees.

One of the best resources you have is your dog's breeder, local basenji club, and the Basenji Club Of America.  In general, most basenji breeders are very conscious of their dogs' health, and these organizations have amassed hundreds of years experience in dealing with matters pertaining to the health of the breed.

FEEDING YOUR BASENJI

In addition to a loving home, someone to play with, and a warm dry place to sleep your basenji will need food and water.  These necessities, along with a good exercise program, will keep your dog happy and fit for a long healthy life.

Maintain the same type of feed and schedule the breeder or previous owner used.  Introduction to a new home is very stressful, especially to puppies, so many times they will refuse to eat for the first 24 hours or so.   Avoid adding stress to the situation by changing the type of food or the feeding schedule. Such changes should be made gradually through the duration of a week or more.  Stay with a name brand that your breeder or vet recommends.  Avoid the generic brands if possible.

A separate feeding dish for each dog is strongly recommended, along with a water bowl large enough to supply all your dogs. Several water bowls may be used around the house and outside, in such places as the kitchen, porch, fenced dog run, and even the bath-room.  Many dogs enjoy drinking from the toilet bowl. Drinking from the toilet bowl or any other place where chemicals are added should be strongly discouraged.  Though you may not use such chemicals, you are training your dog that this is an acceptable place to drink. When visiting grandma or even next door, this familiar drinking spot may become a bowl of poison!

Discourage your dog from drinking from puddles that form near driveways and automobiles.  Such water may contain oil, gas, detergents, insecticides, or even antifreeze, which has a tempting flavor that dogs like very much.  These puddles can be lethal depend-ing on what they contain, and the amount consumed. Do not use insecticides, detergents, paints, or any other chemicals around pet dishes without moving them first and placing them back when the area is safe, with fresh clean water and food.  In the majority of poisoning accidents, the owner inadvertently poisons his own dog by using such chemicals around pet dishes.

Pet dishes should be cleaned regularly and made of heavy ceramic or stainless steel, the latter being preferred.  Plastic bowls are acceptable, but your basenji may regard these as toys and empty their con-tents just to be able to carry them off to his favorite chewing spot.

 

Feeding should be done on a regular time schedule, regardless of the number of feedings per day. This allows the dog's digestive system to establish a bio-logical clock to produce stomach acids, along with periods of rest for the system.  This timing is very important in housebreaking because it helps to estab-lish a regular time for elimination.  An adult dog should be fed once or twice daily.  Puppies under six months of age should be fed three times daily, then twice daily until at least 12 months of age.  The amount and schedule should be adjusted to the weight of the dog.  Weigh your dog occasionally, to monitor weight gain or loss. Ribs & hip bones should be felt but not seen.

Treats should be given sparingly.  Many treats are too rich for the dog's digestive system.  Excessive amounts of these treats may cause dietary imbalance, loose stools, and foul smelling flatus. This can lead to very serious digestive problems such as explosive diarrhea, malnutrition, and stomach ulcers.

Do not give your basenji candies, pastries, cakes, etc.  These treats containing complex sugars serve no nutritional value for your dog and may promote many health problems, varying from tooth decay and gum disease to kidney disorders.  Two ounces of Chocolate will make a 25 pound dog ill, and 16 ounces can be fatal.  Chocolate is very toxic to all animal life.  Treat your basenji to scrap meats or commercially prepared treats such as 'Milk Bones', 'Beef Bites', or possibly vegetables and fruits that your dog may take a liking to.

There is no evidence to suggest that the addition of vitamins and minerals in excess of the dog's require-ments has any beneficial effect.  Do not try to diagnose nutrient deficiency or problems with the dog's utilization of a nutrient.   Many nutrient defi-ciencies or over supplementation of a nutrient may be the cause of that poor coat or weak joint. If you sus-pect such a problem, consult your vet.

Rawhide is a treat all basenjis enjoy.  Many basenjis devour rawhide too much at one time.  It can be very dangerous, becoming lodged in the dog's throat.  If you do treat your basenji to rawhide, do not leave the dog unattended.  Be prepared to use your index and middle fingers to remove any large pieces that may become lodged in his throat.  Avoid bleached rawhides which are softer and more quickly devoured.  A basenji may try to swallow the stick shapes or small chips whole after only a brief chew, leading to choking or possible puncture of throat, stomach, or intestines.  Use large knotted bone shapes and throw out small pieces that they may chew off.  Limit the time that your basenji may chew on the rawhide to 30 supervised minutes.  Some would chew on rawhide until the entire bone was devoured if given the chance. Excessive rawhide is not good for the diet.

Do not underestimate the strength of a basenji jaw.  Fresh bones of any size (even the largest knuckles) are subject to slivering under the basenji jaw.   These slivers may puncture the throat, stomach, or intestines, or at least cause great discomfort to your dog.  Those bones which have been baked (fired) until rock hard can cause excessive wear on the teeth, or even break a tooth. Many breeders no longer give their basenjis bones or rawhide.  If you should treat your basenji to these, use extreme caution.  See article on 'chewing'.

FIRST AID

First aid is the immediate treatment prior to seek-ing professional help.  Knowing how and when to apply first aid may save your Basenji's life and reduce expensive emergency care.

First aid begins by buying a good reference book and reading it!  Study the methods and techniques of first aid.  The "AKC Book of Dogs" has a good section on first aid, and other books are listed in the bibliography.  Keep these reference books at a convenient location at all times.

Establish a regular veterinarian as soon as possible - don't wait for your dog's yearly vaccination.  If the dog you bought is fully vaccinated, check with your breeder on which vaccines the dog has received and when the next ones are due.  You should bring your dog to a reliable veterinarian within 6 weeks of purchasing him, even if only a checkup is in order.  An injured dog responds much better when handled by someone he already knows, so don't wait until an emergency occurs for the doctor to establish a relationship with your basenji.

Heat stroke is very common in today's fast paced society.  The number one culprit is the car.  Always leave the windows - all windows - down one inch when leaving your pet in the car.  It is quite possible for a dog to suffocate in a car even when it is cold outside.  When the temperature reaches 60 degrees, park the car in the shade, and pay close attention that the car remains shaded.  Check on the dog frequently and give him some water. When the temperature reaches 70 degrees, Do not leave him in the car. Leave him at home on these warm days if he cannot be outside.  A car, even with all windows down, can warm up inside to 80 plus degrees.  A dog inside a crate can continue to generate this heat to 90 plus degrees through his own body temperature and, not being able to cool himself down, creates a deadly situation of heat stroke.

If you must confine your dog on these warm days, place his well ventilated crate outside in the shade.  Check on him frequently and give him water to drink.  If the day should warm up to 80 degrees plus in the shade, or if your basenji pants when in shade, do not confine him.  He needs as much air ventilation as possible; he may hyperventilate due only to confine-ment.  This is when he's better off left at home in the coolness of your house.

The signs of heat stroke are: lethargy, limpness, heavy panting, hyperventilation, frantic attempts to find shade or escape from confinement.  It doesn't take long for heat stroke to become fatal if not treated. Dogs that are dehydrated are far more susceptible to heat stroke. Make sure he has water.

Treatment for heat stroke is simple and must be immediate. Immerse him in water as soon as possible.  A mud puddle will do. Roll him in it, wetting his coat and feet; evaporative cooling will do the rest.  If there is no water around, spray him down with that cold 6 pack of soda you may have. It's very important to cool him down as soon as possible, any way possible.  If the poor dog should be locked in a car, don't hesitate to knock out the window with a rock.  No truly responsible pet owner values that window over his pet.  Do not throw him into deep water.  Many heat stroke victims are on the verge of unconsciousness, and may drown. Once the dog is cooled down, offer him small drinks of water, 1/4 cup approximately for a 25 pound dog, every 15 minutes or so.  Do not allow him to drink freely.  He may bloat himself, and this can be deadly.

Hypothermia is the reverse of heat stroke, but the treatment is similar.  Hypothermia usually strikes the young pup or the weak dog.  This occurs when the dog is exposed to sudden extreme cold or prolonged cold.  It is often accompanied by shock.  Hypothermia occurs when the body has failed to maintain proper temperature. Signs of hypothermia setting in are exhibited in shivering dogs that are cold to the touch.  These dogs will lie tightly curled, attempting to maintain their body temperature.  This is followed by lethargic movement and possible unconsciousness.  Respiratory and or cardiovascular arrest is soon to follow, resulting in death.

Treatment is simple, but must be immediate. Warm the dog by immersing him in warm water, 85-90 degrees.  Do not use hot water, as it will be a shock for the dog.  If there is no warm water around, place him next to your skin under heavy clothing.  warm him in any way possible, as soon as possible.  Warming should be gradual: avoid heaters and other appliances that will heat him up too fast, creating severe shock.  Once warm, the dog should show motion responses.  Rub down the dog with a dry towel to generate friction heat after first warming him with water or your body heat. Don't rub too hard, for cold blood vessels are easily damaged.  Any dog which has experienced heat stroke or hypothermia should be taken to a vet as soon as possible after first aid is given.

Accidents.  The #1 cause of basenji deaths is the auto.  Basenjis have no regard for the moving auto, and those who have attempted to teach them respect usually end up with fatal results. Don't let your dog run loose.

If your dog gets hit by a car, don't panic!  Quick, decisive action is necessary to prevent further injury. If the dog is still on his feet and moving around, approach him with extreme care.  Call him by name, but most likely he will not recognize you due to the shock of the accident or the pain he's now suffering. Be ready to wrap a shirt, towel, or anything around his jaw to prevent him from biting.  He may even bite himself in the confusion.

Once subdued, reassure him he's okay.  To avoid possible further injury, place a board, jacket, blanket, or anything similar under him, lifting him in it by the 4 corners. Get help to carry him, if possible.  Be very careful to not move him more than necessary.  Keep him calm by talking to him. Don't allow him to thrash around, and get him to a vet as soon as possible.  Unless there is massive bleeding, or getting him to a vet will take too much time, do not try to treat his injuries; leave this to the professionals.

Keep a first aid manual and kit around your house, and bring them along when traveling with your dog.

Treat the dog only for those injuries which can't wait for the care of a veterinarian.  Write down the name of your vet, his phone number and address.   Also include an emergency center phone number and address to refer to when your vet may be closed.  Keep this in your first aid kit and by your phone.  In the confusion, this information is easily forgotten.

POISONING

You must protect your basenji against accidental poisoning much as you would a child.  Before bring-ing your basenji home, take a tour of your house and garage, and poison-proof by storing all potential poi-sons, such as cleaning chemicals, rat poisons, etc., in locked childproof cupboards or on too-high-to-reach shelves or cupboards.  Remember, basenjis love to drink from the toilet, so don't use bowl cleaning chemicals.

Basenjis also love to lick their paws, so anything they walk through could be potentially toxic (slug bait, antifreeze, etc.). Chocolate is toxic to dogs and should not be fed.  Also, Acetaminophen (Tylenol, Anacin 3) and Ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) are toxic to dogs and should not be given.  Aspirin is OK, but you should check with your vet before administering any medication to your dog.

A large number of plants, including many com-mon house and garden plants are toxic to dogs as well as humans.  The list is far too long to include here.  A good suggestion is to request a list of toxic plants from your local poison control center, or from your vet, or consult a good veterinary manual.  Basenjis are "grazers" so you will need to supervise and make sure your basenji does not nibble the house or garden plants.  Decorative plants can be placed in hanging baskets or on high shelves.  A fenced play- run area with no plants is a good idea for your basenji.  Exercise close supervision on outings.

If you suspect your basenji may have ingested a poisonous plant or substance, try to keep him quiet and get to your vet immediately.

UNDESIRABLE CHEWING AND POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES

Veteran basenji owners are fully aware of the notorious habit of chewing on attractive parts of reachable objects or anything unattached.  The occa-sional eaten pen, pencil, clothing, soft dog bed or crate edges often seem to have no harmful effects.  One owner's favorite remark, "It all comes out in the end," is always good for a laugh, and most basenji owners have tales of colorful fecal deposits.  Many ingested objects are vomited before they have a chance to reach the intestines.  

But for one puppy, eating what he shouldn't had more drastic effects.  The little fellow slept well during the drive home from a dog show and had a good nap upon arrival.  He wanted and ate dinner, but lost that later in the evening.  He started acting as if he needed to relieve his bowels, but was unsuccessful.  Morning brought a trip to the vet.  He had no temperature.  A day of barium X-rays revealed a slow intestinal track, but an open one.  But by now the puppy was in obvious pain, experiencing continual intestinal cramping, and still unable to relieve himself.

 

Late that night, his surgery began.  During a 3 hour surgery, a one foot section of his intestines was removed, as well as another 6 inch section further along. How could this have happened?

After trying different scatter rugs or floor mats in the kitchen, where the puppies spent the majority of their time, the puppy's owners (basenji owners and breeders with 13 years of experience) were using rubber-backed mats of supposedly tightly woven rug fibers.  Oh sure, they nibbled the edges, but they never tore off large hunks of the rugs.  However, these tiny pieces of backing with connected, running fibers had slowing collected in intestinal pockets and attracted even more "debris" - various little pieces of nonfood items.  All this time, the intestines were continually trying to dissolve and pass this foreign material.  Result -breakdown of tissue.

It was uncertain whether the puppy could survive the shock of the operation even though he had sur-vived the actual surgery.  The three hours following surgery were as tense as the three in surgery.  His owner worked for her vet, and was able to be there when he awoke and help him through the shock period.  He had one of the best vets in the area.  His knowledge and expertise were the principal reasons this puppy survived.

Throughout the healing process, the puppy was in periodic pain; at first the pain was constant.  At the beginning of his recovery, he did not want to eat  -- when he was finally off IV's and allowed to eat nor-mally.  He lost drastic amounts of weight. He progressed from mushy special diets to quality canned food to thoroughly dissolved dry food mixed with canned.  He ate tiny, frequent meals.  Each meal was followed by severe intestinal cramps and pain, as his shortened intestines tried to do their job.  There were months of virtually sleepless nights, for the puppy and his humans.  Specific exercises were a must in order to prevent adhesions, stimulate blood flow, and encourage healing. But finally one night he was sleeping a little easier, and one day he tried to play with his active, joyful sisters.  No one knew if he would ever really be "normal" again, or if this was "as good as it gets",  but 8 months after the surgery, his people could see that the days of pain and stress were fewer than those without it.

But it wasn't all downhill from the surgery - you see, this fellow was still a basenji.  As his health improved, so did his appetite, and his normal chewing habits.  His area was made even more "chew-proof" than that of the other puppies, and someone was always delegated to watch "Boo-Boo", as he became known.  One day, he and his mother destroyed the hard plastic base of a soft dog bed. That time he got medication that caused him to vomit and thus get rid of anything that might be in his stomach before it could reach his intestines. It is hard to believe, but 3 weeks later he was still occasionally vomiting pieces of plastic.

"Boo-Boo" was a sweet, gentle, lovable and loving puppy before all this happened.  Remarkably, he is still pretty much the same puppy.  He is more defensive with his peers than the others are.  He expects preferential treatment from humans, because he had so much attention for so long.  He and his people are all working on this. During "Boo-Boo's" illness, he would be crated to get over his occasional snits or panics.  The door of the crate is left open when it's not in use, and now when "Boo-Boo" throws a tantrum, he runs into the crate where he can scream or fuss without harm or punishment.  Sometimes his owners remind him, by saying "Boo-Boo, go crate yourself."  He does.

Some people will wonder why he wasn't just "put down".  This kind of decision is seldom as easy as it looks to an outsider.  There was no way of knowing up front the severity of his problem, and the length and difficulty of his recovery.   Would they go through it again?  YES! His life and his safety were their responsibility, and he did survive. He is a marvelous little fellow.  It was fun to see him experience his first Christmas, a year late, and to watch him learn to play  -- free of pain.  ["Boo-Boo" has since earned a Junior Courser title in lure coursing.  Though he’s not fast, he enjoys being able to run free and chase the “bunny”].

The vet who treated him said this puppy's experi-ence was the worst of its type he had seen. This trait and problem are not specific to our breed, and a simple operation is usually sufficient to remove the ingested object.  Usually the stories are humorous, and the solutions relatively simple, although expensive. 

Why go through such an ordeal, however, if you can prevent it?  Learn from this owners experience: Keep toddler toys away from dogs.  They are small, often smell good and are too often within the dog's reach.  Keep an eye on your dog.  A quiet basenji is not necessarily a sleeping basenji.  Pick up around your house.  Control and restrict your dog's activity area.  He doesn't need the run of the entire house.  Usually, he wants to be with you anyway. He's an intelligent, inquisitive, active, agile, healthy animal.  That's why we love our breed, isn't it?  Protect him... and while you're at it, you'll preserve your belongings.  Not such a bad deal!

 

PREVENTIVE BREEDING

The female Basenji's estrus cycle is very unique in that the majority of females have but one 'season' per year.  A few basenji bitches will have more than one season a year, but this usually occurs when the basenji has been raised with other breeds having two or more cycles a year.  Also unique is the uncanny timing that the basenji exhibits, with the majority coming into season in late summer to early fall.  You'll probably notice your dog was born in the month of November, December, or January.  By subtracting the 63 day (plus or minus 2 days) gestation you can determine the time of year the dam of your dog was mated. Odds are that your bitch will continue this inherited pattern.

A puppy bitch's first season can occur as early as six months of age or as late as a year.  No basenji should be bred on the first season.  They are not men-tally or physically mature enough to cope with the stress of having puppies or even the stress of mating.  Some puppies will exhibit a false cycle at sexual development to be followed up with a fertile season in a few months.

Signs of your basenji being in season are, in vary-ing degrees, mood changes, flirting with males, swelling of the vulva, vaginal discharge: beginning dark red, and the bitch repeatedly cleaning the area.  It is quite possible that a basenji with a strong instinct to keep herself clean, along with a very little swelling and discharge, could complete her cycle without you knowing it. Talk to your dog's breeder about these possibilities, as such behavior is usually exhibited in your dog's ancestors.

False pregnancies are a common phenomenon among basenjis. Due to hormonal changes, she may exhibit weight gain, mild breast swelling, and nesting behavior.  No treatment is generally needed for a false pregnancy unless there is actual milk production.

Preventive breeding may be accomplished in many ways.  These include surgical spaying or neutering, drug contraceptives for either sex, and isolation.  Sur-gical spaying or neutering is the best way to prevent unwanted pups.  Spaying the female is the removal of the ovaries.  The uterus should also be removed to prevent possible infection later on. Neutering is the removal of both the male dog's testicles. Dogs with one or both of the testes undescended should be neu-tered.  This is a serious fault that you should not allow the male dog to pass to future generations.  Removal of the recessed testicle is necessary to complete the neutering and to assure the dog's good health. Cutting of the tubes (vasectomy) is effective but does not have any health or behavioral benefits and is not recommended.

"When should I have my dog fixed?"  This is a subject of a lot of opinion.  Puppies that have not sexually matured may be 'fixed' to eliminate some of the bad habits of an adult dog, such as marking, roaming, and fighting.  This is not always the case in an inherently dominant dog, (referred to as 'ALPHA' male), which may continue to display these behavior traits, even though neutered.

A personality change occurs when a female has her first season or when a male becomes sexually active.  It is not necessary for a dog to go through this personality change to become the so called 'complete dog'.  If you are pleased with the personality of your dog prior to sexual maturity, why take a chance on an unpredictable personality change?  This likewise applies to the old fable that a female should have a litter of pups prior to being 'fixed', to make her that 'complete dog'.  There is no doubt that a dog's personality changes during these stages but the change is not always for the better.  A female may become protective of her home after she has experienced having pups or your male may find roaming sexually satisfying.

Spaying and neutering are permanent and irre-versible.  Before spaying or neutering, make sure it is in accord with any conditions the breeder may have placed on the sale of the dog. Altered dogs cannot be exhibited in conformation at AKC dog shows.  The American Sighthound Field Association and the AKC tracking and obedience trials do permit altered dogs to compete.

If you find spaying or neutering not practical, due to future breeding prospects or a conformation show career, there are two other means to prevent breeding.  There is an oral contraceptive drug currently available on the market for both sexes. Discuss possible side effects with your veterinarian.

The most widely used method to prevent mating when spaying is not practical is confinement and iso-lation for the female when in season.  Females in season require extra care in confinement and must be isolated from all males.  Your backyard will not be safe for her unless you have the ultimate fence.  Remember, you are now trying to keep other dogs out, and all the dogs in the neighborhood have probably picked up her scent.  Their ability to get in may be far greater than your basenji's ability to get out.

If you don't have a fully enclosed dog run or that ultimate fence, walk your bitch on a leash (even if it is in your back yard).  Be prepared to pick her up should another dog approach her.  It only takes seconds for a mating to take place, and a tie is not necessary for conception to take place.

Avoid walking her around the neighborhood. She will mark everything in sight, laying down a scent to attract all males. You just might have a few dogs maintaining a 24 hours vigil at your doorstep.  Don't be surprised if one tries to sneak in when the door is opened.

 

The basenji estrus cycle occurs over a 30 day period, beginning with first signs of discharge, appearing dark red in color.  Over approximately 14 days, this discharge will change, becoming bright red, eventually becoming a translucent red/clear.  Many new dog owners associate this red discharge as the season and once it disappears the season is over.  This concept of a season is far from the truth.  Upon approximately the 14th day, with an indication of clear discharge, the dog is at its most fertile period.  Most breedings take place between the 14th to the 20th day, but may occur as early as the 9th day and as late as the 27th day.

It may be difficult to be sure of the first day of the season. Do not try to count off 9 days before isolating her.  Isolate on the first sign for 30 days. If the season does not follow the pattern started, it may have been interrupted by a trauma or stress, such as shipping, which can extend the cycle.  Cycles that are interrupted fall off prematurely, but may continue to peak once the stress or trauma has passed, extending it beyond 30 days. If you feel this may have occurred, have the bitch examined by a vet.  A vet will be able to determine by doing a smear if the cycle has fin-ished.  It is a minor cost compared to problems of an unwanted litter.  Any time a season extends beyond 30 days, have your bitch examined by a vet to assure the health of the dog.

If you are placed in the position of expecting an unwanted litter, there are termination drugs a vet can administer.  These must be given as soon as possible - hopefully within 24 hours after the mating occurs.  Talk to your vet about the use of these drugs.  There are many possible side affects. Drugs are not 100 percent effective, with litters born regardless of their use.

Should you find your basenji expecting an unwanted litter, talk to your dog breeder or the refer-ence listed at the beginning of this manual. Decisions on the future of the pups are a matter of ethics.
