## SHOWING YOUR BASENJI IN CONFORMATION

Basenjis don't all look alike, and individual breeders have their own idea of the ideal conformation to the standard of the breed.  What is "pet quality" in one person's backyard is "show quality" in another's.  Interpretation of the standard varies greatly.  You enter a show for one judge's opinion, and if you don't like what he/she does, don't enter under said judge again.  Most exhibitors are willing to give a judge a second chance, but not all. It's a good idea to keep a record of what each judge does for each of your dogs as well as the type of dog that they seem to like.

The breeder you got your puppy from usually can supply you with the names and addresses of the dog show superintendents who are in your local area.  These superintendents supply the premium lists, with entry blanks, for shows.  If you need assistance in filling out your entry blanks, ask your breeder or local club member.

Handling classes and fun matches are the best methods for preparing you and your puppy for showing.  Do not enter an all breed AKC licensed show "cold turkey"!  If your puppy's breeder cannot help you, contact someone via your veterinarian. Any of these should be able to direct you to someone who breeds and shows show dogs (any breed will do) for information.  When you have found a handling class, you can get input on handling and training techniques, proper show leads, grooming tips, as well as pre-show experience for you and your puppy.

Above all, aim at having a good time at the dog show.  Don't expect all the other exhibitors to be overly friendly and show the same pride and interest in your puppy that you have.  A lot of exhibitors are uptight before judging, concentrating on their own dog, and watching the judge's ring procedure with the dogs already in the ring. After judging is the time for chit-chat, griping, and congratulating the winners.


## Earning a Championship otherwise known as "FINISHING"

A dog or bitch must accumulate a total of 15 points to become an AKC Champion of Record. These points are earned at AKC-licensed shows by going "Winners Dog" or "Winners Bitch".  The number of points earned at any given show is dependent upon the number of dogs competing. The total of 15 points must include at least two "majors", which are 3, 4, or 5 point wins, and these major wins must be under two different judges.  A dog or bitch which completes its championship will be so notified by AKC in the form of a Championship Certificate, and will be entitled to use the designation Champion ("Ch.") before its registered name.


## SHOW TRAINING

Begin training your puppy as soon as he's settled into your home.  Begin standing exercises by placing your hand under his chin.  Tell him to "stand stay".  Hold the pose for a moment, then release with praise, "such a good dog".  Don't be concerned about foot placement or the like---to get a basenji pup to stand motionless even for a moment is quite an accomplishment.  Make it fun, no corrections with a young dog.  You want to maintain a happy "I enjoy this" attitude.  As time goes by, increase the durations, but not too long. Touch his feet, tail, topline, go over his entire body.

![](images/FPO-mising.png)

Begin examining his teeth by lifting the upper lip at the front of the jaw, approaching his face from the side.  Once he is performing this freely, move your hand over his head.  Many basenjis object to having a hand over the head.  It's important to train your puppy to accept this, for it will happen in the ring. In attempting to examine your Basenji's teeth, you'll probably find controlling his head without a collar quite a challenge.

Take a soft nylon choke collar or loop show lead, and place it under his chin right behind the ears where the head meets the neck.  Hold this in a loop fashion, with enough slack in the loop to grasp it with your fingers.  Don't strangle the dog, the intent is control of the head.  Practice getting you and your puppy used to the collar placement by doing stand-stays before doing examinations of the body or teeth.

Remember to keep the lessons very short and have lots of fun. There are no wrongs here.  Don't bore or frustrate your puppy. Practice on the floor, grass yard, and on stable tables at eye level such as the kitchen table or a picnic table outside. Place a carpet, mat or towel on slippery surfaces. A table in your yard for your basenji to perch on can be a great asset.  Basenjis love to perch, standing or sitting and it is easy to encourage. Make sure the table is stable and solid.

Use food to reward the dog for being able to place the feet or hold longer poses, but only give bait to your basenji when his ears are up.  There's a very fine art to baiting a dog for expression and alert poses.  It's best to seek handling training to learn the baiting techniques.  This is not a must requirement of home training for a puppy.

The final achievement is to be able to place your puppy in a four point stance, with his rear feet set slightly wider than the front, and hocks perpendicular to the surface.  This is the portion of the rear leg just above the foot.  Front feet should be set directly below the shoulder, perpendicular to the surface. Set the front feet to a width identical to the width of the chest. Now, holding this pose, examine the body & teeth.

Take your time, don't rush, even the most amiable puppy might take six or more months to achieve perfection.  Puppies in shows aren't expected to be perfect in this training.  Even some young adults haven't mastered the standing pose & examination yet.

Leash training for show begins with a good leash, referred to as a lead.  Many types of show leads are available.  Recommended for puppy training is a 1/4" diameter soft nylon choke with a fine 4' long lead (nylon, Cordahide, 3/16" fine leather).  These leads should only be used for show, and should be different in feel & weight than ones used for everyday walking.

Begin by walking your dog slowly to one side or the other. Coax him along with bait, call his name ("puppy, puppy" etc.).  Be gentle---don't drag him. Keep the lead taut, by gathering the remaining slack in your hand.  The leash should be taut enough so the pup can't put his nose to the ground. Use bait to help keep his head up and looking forward.  Move him slowly up and down a sidewalk or yard.  In this exercise, pattern training is established.  This is where differences in a show lead and your general walking leash play a role. After pattern training a while, your puppy will recognize the differences in these two leads.  He will know what your expectations of him are when a show lead is on.  The showing of a dog's movement is done in trotting gait.  Practice controlling this gait at a slow speed, maintaining a straight line for both you and the dog.  Sidewalk lines and parking lot stripes are very helpful.  Dogs are usually gaited off your left side, but you may be required to move him on your right in some situations, so practice both.

As your puppy gets older and is easily lead.  You may wish to use a fine jewelry link choke instead of nylon.  Remember, these are of light construction and are not intended for lead pops or yanking your dog along.  Light lead pops with a choke may be used with an older dog whose lead training has been previously established.  Refrain from doing this with a green puppy.

Remember to keep all show training positive, fun, and enjoyable for your puppy.  Attitude is very important in the show ring.  Even the finest of basenjis would have a hard time winning in the show ring if he exhibits what's called the "hung dog look".

The exercises discussed are intended for home preparation for dog showing, but are a benefit for any dog, to be shown or not.

Show training should also include fun matches (informal dog shows for training purposes) usually put on by dog clubs, organized puppy practices by breed clubs and breeders, and dog show handling classes.  These are necessary for the socialization and acclimatization of your puppy to the dog show environment. Have fun and best wishes to a winning team.


## LURE COURSING

![](images/FPO-missing.png)

_**Tally ho!**_  Three basenjis spring from the slip, running, turning, straining every muscle to catch a tumbling lure as enthusiastically as their ancestors did to catch live game not so many generations ago.  It is a breathtaking spectacle---beautiful, healthy hounds exerting themselves to the limit in an activity similar to the one for which they were bred.

Coursing is a sport as old as the first relationship between hound and man.  However, in the days gone by it was not done for amusement, but to get food or eliminate predators.  In these gentler times, coursing live game is no longer necessary for survival.  We can still give our basenjis (and ourselves) the excitement of the hunt through the sport of lure coursing.  We merely replace the live game with an artificial lure tied to a string and pulled along a random course through an open field. Basenjis are hunting dogs of the native African tribes, and they are oblivious to (or good naturedly ignore!) the fact that the lure is only a white plastic bag.

Why should I lure course my basenji?  First, he'll probably love it.  Even the most pampered and dignified of sighthounds can rarely resist the opportunity to chase and catch something---anything!  Second, it's a great way to keep him healthy and fit. A basenji in proper shape is trim and muscular, with heart, lungs, and circulation in peak condition.  Third, it gives you a chance to evaluate him in a way that the show ring cannot.  More and more of the finest basenjis are earning championships both in the field and in the ring.

There are two separate organizations that grant titles to dogs competing in Lure Course events: the ASFA and the AKC.

The American Sighthound Field Association (ASFA) is an organization of sighthound fanciers dedicated to the common goal of preserving and further developing the natural beauty, grace, speed, and coursing skill of the sighthound.  They promote a recognized system of lure field trials for sighthounds throughout the United States.

By competing in these lure field trials your basenji can earn the titles of Field Champion (F.Ch.) and Lure Courser Of Merit (LCM). The Basenji became eligible to compete in lure field trials in 1979 under ASFA rules.  The breeds eligible to compete include Afghan Hounds, Basenjis, Borzois, Greyhounds, Ibizan Hounds, Irish Wolfhounds, Pharaoh Hounds, Rhodesian Ridgebacks, Salukis, Scottish Deerhounds, and Whippets.

In actual competition, the dogs run in groups of twos or threes (they wear colored blankets so the judges can tell them apart), and they are scored subjectively and objectively in the following five categories: Enthusiasm, Follow (How well the dog follows the lure), Speed (however, they are not timed), Agility, and Endurance.  Dogs can be excused, dismissed, or disqualified for not running, interfering with another dog, or fighting with another dog.  The dogs earn points according to how many dogs they defeat.  The dogs with the four best qualifying scores each earn points at a trial.  A dog must earn 100 points to become a Field Champion.

The AKC recognized lure coursing as an official sport in 1991 and began to organize their own system of trials and titles.  

![](images/FPO-missing.png)

Under the AKC rules, a sighthound may earn a 'JC' Junior Courser title by completing a course alone at two different tests. A 'SC' Senior Courser title is earned by completing a course running with other dogs at four different trials. An 'MC' Master Courser title is earned by completing a course running with other dogs an additional twenty five times. A 'FCH' Field Champion and 'LCX' Lure Courser Excellent title are awarded by earning enough points and placements in competition with other dogs.  The trial procedures are similar to ASFA but the titles earned have a completely different set of requirements.

The Evergreen Basenji Club is a member of ASFA and is approved to hold both ASFA and AKC lure field trials.  There are clubs all over the country which, like EBC, hold practice runs for puppies (older than four months), dogs training for competition (must be one year old to compete), and any dog that just loves to run.

PRACTICES:  Basenjis may be brought out to their first practice at any age.  Bring your dog out to watch the other dogs run and see the lure before it is his turn.  Depending on how enthusiastic your dog seems, you can begin on a long straightaway of maybe half of the course.  Praise and encourage your basenji profusely for any interest he shows in the lure.  Play rag games with your basenji before and after coming to a lure practice. Play plastic bag-on-the-end-of-the-string type games to acquaint your dog with chasing things that move on the ground.

Your basenji may or may not chase the lure in the beginning. It may take several practices before the idea "clicks" in his mind.  He may feel insecure being let off the leash for the first time.  Keep bringing him out to watch, play the rag games at home. Do not discipline your basenji for grabbing or tearing up the lure, or for staying with the lure when the lure has stopped. Encourage your dog to "get the bunny".

Many basenji owners are apprehensive about letting their dogs off the leash. This is understandable, but be reassured that we have never lost a dog at a practice or trial.  With all the excitement of the people, dogs, and lure, any wandering basenji usually stays close enough to be bribed in with some food. Remember, NEVER scold your basenji when he comes to you no matter how exasperated you are when you finally catch him. If you do, he probably won't let himself be caught the next time.  Greet him with praise and a treat so he will be willing to come to you and be 'caught'.  Be ready at the finish point to retrieve your basenji as soon as he comes in on the lure. Use lots of praise.

Do not feed your dog a full meal before running. Bring some water for your dog, but cool him down by 'walking out' after running, and give him water after he has relaxed.  Don't run your dog when he is tired.  Stop a course or two before he runs out of steam.

Training for competition: Before a dog is ready to run with any competition on the course, he should let nothing distract his attention from the lure. Hounds should complete the course alone many times at different practice events before running with any other hound!!!

The most critical period in the hound's preparation for being a lure courser is his first few courses with other hounds. A novice hound can easily be ruined by a hound interfering with its course. The novice hound may be confused and distracted from the lure and begin playing with the other hound, or stop running completely. When a hound has a bad experience when first starting to lure course, it is sometimes impossible to erase that memory from the hound's mind.

In some instances, when a dog shows some interest in the lure but does not complete the course, it may help to run him a few times with an experienced runner.

One proven method of training a clean running dog (one that does not interfere) is to run the dog muzzled the first several times he runs with another dog.  In the majority of dogs who are 'on the lure' the muzzle does not bother them while they are in pursuit.  Lightweight racing muzzles are suitable for practice and are legal to use in actual competition.  Let your dog have several 'clean' runs before entering in actual competition. You run the risk of a dismissal or disqualification if your dog interferes with another dog while coursing.

Make sure you are ready at the finish to retrieve your basenji as soon as the lure has stopped.  Most basenjis are not willing to share the prize they have worked so hard to catch.

Special considerations for puppies: Bring your puppy out to practice as soon as he has had his shots.  This is a great opportunity for socialization.  A puppy under about six months should only be run on short, straight, 50 yard dashes because he lacks the attention span and muscle development to follow the lure around a turn or run further.  At this age you can run along with him and play 'get the bunny'.  As your puppy gets the idea, you can gradually increase the distance and the number of corners he must follow. A puppy under about six months should not run more than 200 yards.  This is the length of an average practice course. In actual competition, the course is 500 to 1200 yards.  Always run your puppy alone.  He can't concentrate on the lure when he has a playmate, too.  Remember to praise, praise, praise your puppy's interest in the lure.


## OBEDIENCE TRIALS

Basenjis are not a common sight in the obedience ring.  They do have a reputation for not being an easy breed to train.  However, with a lot of study and education on your part, and some consistent work training your basenji, you can establish a unique relationship between you and your basenji that can be extremely rewarding.

There is much discouragement out there for a novice basenji trainer.  Experienced obedience trainers may tell you to find an easier breed to train.  Even some basenji breeders may tell you that basenjis are not meant to be obedience trained.  This is a decision and commitment you will have to make for yourself and your dog.

![](images/BAS40.png)

There is much support if you do decide to train in obedience. Many basenjis have done very well in the obedience ring, earning advanced titles. Trainers are realizing the intelligence and stubbornness of the Basenji, and how quickly they get bored with the basic obedience routines.

All dogs should learn how to walk nicely on a leash and sit still when told to.  They make much better pets to live with if they can.  A basic obedience class will help you train your basenji in these basic exercises regardless of your intent to compete.  To compete in obedience requires more precision in these exercises, and for the dog and handler to work as a team.  Try to find an instructor who is experienced in working with hounds or terriers and is willing to work closely with you to solve problems.

You will find that different techniques work better for different dogs.  You can begin training your dog at any age.  They are never too old to start, nor too young. For young puppies, many trainers recommend that you follow the guidelines outlined in the 'Super Dog' article.  Use lots of positive reinforcement.  Do not expect perfection at an early age. Do your sit-stays and down-stays for only a few seconds (a puppy's attention span is not very long). Praise profusely when puppy sits on your command. Make it a fun game!  Experienced basenji trainers recommend that you don't start the precision work needed for competition until the dog is well over a year old---but do start training earlier.

With an independent, super-alert, curious basenji, a prime problem is getting and keeping his attention.  One technique found exceptionally useful is the long-line exercise outlined in Koehler Method of Dog Training.

With an adult basenji, it is recommended that you work a few weeks with this long-line technique before you take an obedience class. This will help you keep your dog's attention even in a room full of distractions.  Another good manual full of training tips to keep your dog's attention focused on you, to get high scores in competition, is Beyond Basic Training.  You may find that the way to your Basenji's mind is through his stomach. Be generous with the pup treats and praise when he is first learning an exercise. This will make a faster and more enthusiastic learner.

Your dog does not understand sustained displeasure. Don't moralize about your dog's behavior---he doesn't. He does what his instincts and experience dictate. Correct a goof and go on to something else.  Do not allow the instructor or any other 'stranger' to give any harsh physical corrections to your basenji. This can lead to fear of strangers that is difficult to overcome. Do any physical corrections yourself.

Learn to observe your dog, to read why he makes a mistake.  The correction for a dog who is confused or afraid is different from the correction used for a dog that is distracted or one that feels he has a choice.  Knowing when to correct a dog can be more important than knowing how to correct him.

Give your dog a 'leader' he can respect by being patient, consistent, and fair.  Couple this with praise---praise that is as sincere the thousandth time he does what you want as it was the first time.  Your result will be a basenji that responds, at least most of the time, with an eager desire to please---except for an occasional challenge, to make sure you still deserve to be his pack leader!


## CANINE GOOD CITIZEN

The Canine Good Citizen Test is to demonstrate that the dog can be trained to behave in the home, in public places, and in the presence of other dogs. It is not a competitive program, but a program of certification. In order to receive the title and certificate for CGC, your dog must be able to pass ten tests which demonstrate that the handler is in control of the dog under conditions the dog is likely to encounter on a daily basis. Tests are on a pass/fail basis only. The tests can be done in any order, but the dog must pass all ten to qualify for the CGC title.

  1.  Accepting a Friendly Stranger.

  2.  Sitting Politely for Petting.

  3.  Appearance and Grooming.

  4.  Walking on a Loose Leash---Out for a Walk.

  5.  Walking Through a Crowd.

  6.  Sit and Down on Command. Staying in Place.

  7.  Praise/Interaction.

  8.  Reaction to Another Dog.

  9.  Reaction to Distractions.

  10. Supervised Isolation.

Before passing the dog, the evaluator also considers the following:

  1.  Is this the kind of dog he or she would like to own?

  2.  Is this the kind of dog that would be good with children?

  3.  Is this the kind of dog that he or she would welcome as a neighbor?

  4. Is this the kind of dog that makes the owner happy and isn't making someone else unhappy?


## JUNIOR SHOWMANSHIP

If your basenji has a young master or mistress, they may wish to participate in Junior Showmanship.  JS Competition, a part of most AKC shows, and fun matches, is an opportunity for your youngster to learn to show his dog in conformation style. The Junior is judged on his ability to handle and present his dog, rather than on the merits of the dog.  Competition is in four classes:

Novice Junior---for juniors age 10 and under 14 who have had less than 3 wins.

Open Junior---for juniors age 10 and under 14 who have had 3 previous wins in the Novice Class.

Novice Senior---for juniors age 14 and under 18 who have had less than 3 wins.

Open Senior---for juniors age 14 and under 18 who have had 3 previous wins in the Novice Class.

Ribbons and sometime trophies are awarded for first through fourth places in each class.  Winners of the four classes compete for Best Junior Showman---and a rosette and trophy.

![](images/BAS49.png)

Top winning Juniors compete for a variety of local and national honors.  The Basenji Club of America recognizes top-winning juniors each year. Records and achievements of all Basenji Junior Showmen are published in the Junior Showmanship column of the quarterly Bulletin of the BCOA; the BCOA also presents a trophy or award to the Top Scoring Junior Showman for each year.   Juniors achieving a certain number of Open Class wins during a year are eligible to enter limited Junior Showmanship competitions, such as The Westminster Kennel Club Junior Limited at Madison Square Garden, the ultimate experience of a Junior Showman's career!

Junior Showmanship is a fun and educational activity for youngsters, dogs, and their families. The juniors learn how to present their dogs and themselves.  Both dog and Junior gain experience, poise and self confidence.  They meet and compete with youngsters and their dogs of all breeds.  Most of all, a spirit of camaraderie and sportsmanship is developed among the Juniors and their families.

Juniors are usually welcome at local breed club classes, as well as many all breed training classes. Occasionally, former Junior Showmen offer handling classes especially for Juniors. Check with your breeder or with Junior members of a local basenji club, who will be glad to help your Junior get started.
